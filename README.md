## Features
- Move with arrow keys
- Place a bomb with space bar
- Detect collision with outer walls, bricks, inner walls
- Clear bricks and path with bombs, able to walk through


## Current Bugs

1. *burger*: Burger bomb glitches when too many are placed at the same time.

## Fixed Bugs

1. *burger*: TEMPORARY FIX, reduced number of bombs to one at a time.
   bombs seem to have stopped glitching.
2. *burger*: Would only not blow up brick bellow bomb, if there was a brick above the bomb.
